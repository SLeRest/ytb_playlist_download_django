# Youtube download playlist

============

Side project for download music and store it in postgreSQL database.
I did it to train after a year without coding with django.

## Installation

#### Classic

You need [python >= 3.8](https://www.python.org/) and [PostgreSQL >= 11](https://www.postgresql.org/).
I recommend to install all the package of requirements.txt in virtual environments.

```
python3 -m venv env

pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py runserver
```
